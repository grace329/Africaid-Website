# Africaid-Website

## Inspiration
We were inspired to create Africaid based on pre-existing platforms that rely on sponsorship or ad-based revenue, such as Ecosia. 

## What it does
The primary purpose of this website is to support the Africaid extension (which can be found here: https://github.com/askanniething/Africaid/). Both of these pieces of software are designed to generate revenue that can be used to support charity organizations such as the African Library Project. Users can utilize this website to learn more about Africaid and submit ads to be placed on the extension. will be greeted by a page of tiled advertisements every time they open a new tab. Africaid offers consumers a free and easy method to support literacy and healthcare in Africa, even when they are unable to donate regularly. 
Companies who want to sponsor ads can learn more on our website and even submit an ad to be placed on our extension. 
As well, Africaid can be used to educate and raise awareness about issues in Africa, such as illiteracy or poverty. We also promote critical social issues and small businesses. 

## How we Built It
We coded the Africaid website primarily using HTML, CSS and JS. To host images, we also connected the extension and website to Google Firebase. The site is currently hosted on GitHub. Cloud Firestore hosts the list of pictures and redirect links.
